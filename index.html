      <h2>How robots are taking over slowly and secretly.</h2>
      <p>We know that people create Artificial Intelligence to help the world. But who's to say that the robots won't turn on us completely, and take over/destroy earth. As we know, robots are much more powerful than us, and they could take all of our jobs someday. In fact, It's guaranteed that they will turn on us.
</p>
      <p>Think about it. We can help the economy, we can help littering and wasting. But we can't help the robot apocalypse. Buy NERF water guns from our site to help support the anti-robot nation. The water guns may be some of the only things to defeat these robots. Buy them from us to support us and you. Join our community. HELP SAVE  HUMANITY!</p>

      <h2>Island found off the coast of Russia with dangerous robot citizens.</h2>
      <p>Four different researchers were cruising off the coast of eastern Russia and had been laughing and talking until they saw an island that had not been on their map. They were eager to explore this area, but they then found their boat being rammed by Flying Robots with blades on them. They were extremely terrified, and they activated the motor and just barely escaped.</p>
